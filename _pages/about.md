I am from Longyan, Fujian. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Robotics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), HKUST(GZ) under the supervision of Prof. Renjing XU. I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Automation \& Robotics from the Hunan University (HNU) in 2023.

I am a self-proclaimed half-stack engineer in robotics. I am interested in computer vision, machine learning, control theory and reinforcement learning. I used to be a RoboMaster.

***Important:*** We are hiring prospective Ph.D. students for 26 Fall. If you are interested in reinforcement learning, HSI/HCI, manipulation, locomotion or robotics in general, feel free to contact me!
