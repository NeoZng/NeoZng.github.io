A robust visual relocalization framework that addresses the challenges of large outlier ratios and excessive map storage requirements using semantic line representations. The method employs Perspective-N-Lines with a saturated consensus approach and accelerated branch-and-bound algorithm for two-stage rotation and translation estimation, achieving robust performance even with 99% outlier matches.

**My Contributions:** Designed the saturation function and derived theoretical guarantees for convergence. Implemented the parallel C++ acceleration for the optimization framework.
